              I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our
              Second Victory Day possible and to the people for giving your
              total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new
              victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I
              fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from
              all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all
              political parties and non-political people to stay calm. This is
              our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities. We must
              protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future
              generations. Our youth is ready to give this leadership in
              creating a new world. Let us not miss the chance by going into any
              senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create
              more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country. If we
              take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please
              stay calm. Help those around you to stay calm.
